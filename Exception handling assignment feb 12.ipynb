    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the interpreter raises an error message and terminates the program if the exception is not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of exceptions in Python, such as IndexError, TypeError, NameError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, etc. Each exception represents a specific type of error that can occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are caused by incorrect syntax in the code and prevent the interpreter from executing the code at all, while exceptions occur during program execution and can be handled by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other key differences between exceptions and syntax errors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be handled with try-except statements, whereas syntax errors cannot.\n",

    "Exceptions occur at runtime, whereas syntax errors occur before runtime during the parsing of the code.\n",

If it is, we raise a NegativeNumberException exception with a message indicating that we cannot calculate the square root of a negative number.\n",
